				<br> German Shepherd
			</td>
			<td>
				German Shepherds are inextricably linked to Western civilization. They are celebrities, police and security dogs, guide and family dogs. They are well-liked and make excellent family dogs. They are well-known for their intelligence and ability to learn rapidly. German Shepherds are wonderful in so many ways that they they are one of my favorite dog breeds.

				<br> Shih Tzu
			</td>
			<td>
				Shih Tzu truly translates to "small lion." Despite how frightening it may seem, they are bred as companion animals and frequently make wonderful family dogs. Shih Tzus are small, active dogs. They require more attention and effort than other breeds. Despite the fact that they may be difficult, Shih Tzus remain one of my favorite dog breeds.

				<br> Siberian Husky
			</td>
			<td>
				Huskies enjoy being around people and other dogs because they are social pack animals. As a result, they make good family dogs in the right home. However, taking care of an adult Siberian Husky is a completely different matter and calls for a lot of commitment. Huskies require a lot of work to maintain because they were bred to be working dogs rather than house pets. Though it may be difficult, the lifestyle that huskies can provide will be for the better, so it is one of my favorite dog breeds.
